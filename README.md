# Anomaly Detection on Industrial Sensors

This project detects anomalies in sensor data from industrial machines using Machine Learning.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Uses real or synthetic sensor data (temperature, pressure, vibration)
- Trains an Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection
- Visualizes normal vs. anomalous data points

## ðŸ›  Installation
To install dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
